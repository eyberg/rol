ROL is ' Ray-uh Light '

yeh.. so whatever, Madonna grows less hot by the day
and we have to compensate..

basically this is a simple project to aquaint myself
with reia, the up and coming badasser of them all

Install:

  None. That is of course as long as you have erlang and reia
  installed. No?? Bad Monkey!

  sudo apt-get install erlang
  git clone git://github.com/tarcieri/reia.git
  cd reia; rake; sudo rake install

Example:

  Let's say we want to document the stdlib tcpsocket class.
  All we need to do is pull out rol and execute:
  (notice that I have not yet done ANY user-defined paths
    so watch yourself before you break yourself)
  
  reia rol.re ../reia/lib/tcpsocket.re

TODO:
  * implement behave: http://github.com/pirj/behave/tree/master
  * maybe transfer to leex/yecc for superior grammar based source 
    parsing?
  * cleanup css
  * cleanup homebrew classes
  * support directories for multiple source files at once
